We would like to evaluate the ability of LLMs to generate workflows based on existing components and libraries. In this experiment we are assuming that we have a Knowledge Base of components and the supported libraries below. Please spend 5 minutes reading the list of components.
Given the list of components and libraries, write intent statements which create a new workflow, containing more than two components.
Please note that you can create workflows strictly based on existing components or you can expound it with custom components. A typical workflow would be of the second type.
Constraints:
-Please diversify in terms of workflow complexity (shorter or longer statements/workflows).
-Please communicate with different levels of detail and specificity.
-Please diversify in terms of components and library functions being used.
-All workflows should end with a deterministic output:
   -Example: ‘Create a workflow that reads a PDF report and outputs its conclusion section.’
   -Counter-example: ‘Create a workflow that reads a PDF report and outputs a summary of it.’
